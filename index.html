        <div class="subheading mb-5">Sociologyüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Hector Castillo and I am currently an undergraduate at UC Riverside, obtaining my Bachelor‚Äôs in Sociology. I currently have an Associates of Arts degree (A.A.) in Psychology from Mount San Antonio Community College but then shifted to Sociology as an undergraduate. I was drawn to psychology and sociology because I grew up in a low-socioeconomic neighborhood, impacted by drugs and gang activity, witnessing how the environment affected families. I am also a first-generation college student and it was very difficult to figure things out and especially find the right career path. Despite hardships, I was able to overcome them, branching out and becoming involved in extracurricular activities and even doing a part time job. These clubs helped me build numerous skills, the main one being social skills, interacting and working with a diverse student population. This will allow me to become more of an involved student and expand my network. I will have the opportunity to apply for internships and attend career workshops to help me become a competitive candidate.
<br><br>

        My main goal is to work with others who need assistance, preferably in social work or in accounting. I do believe I have the right skills and strengths to be able to work in these types of job fields, from prior work experience and being involved on-campus programs throughout my college years, helping me become a well rounded person, a quick learner, a professional communicator, and listener. I am currently working as a waiter and enrolled in UCR. I hope to graduate this upcoming year and hope to transfer back to Mount San Antonio College and obtain my accounting certificate.With these years of education, my big goal is to work my way as a CPA; however, I know it will take far more experience and possibly a higher education to achieve this which is why it is my biggest goal to accomplish.Some possible jobs that I am considering applying for are  banking and bookkeeping, and possibly healthcare insurance.<br><br>

        My mom sacrificed so much in-order to give my sister and I an opportunity to obtain the ‚ÄúAmerican Dream‚Äù. Throughout my life I witnessed my mom working multiple jobs, living paycheck to paycheck in-order to afford the bare necessities like a bedroom, food, and clothing. Seeing my mom struggling made me want to pursue a high paying job so that my family doesn‚Äôt have to struggle anymore as well as showing future generations that they can succeed in an institution of higher education. Understanding how another person is feeling and understanding them beyond their struggles can help me assist people with various delicate situations and challenges. The system we live in was not structured to benefit people like myself but I strongly believe that the more we become educated and uplift our communities we can challenge those inequities. Although everyday is a struggle I am happy that I decided to pursue higher education. Lastly, I want to thank everyone who has read my entire bio. I wish you all the best!
